# DatabaseProject
School database project for SQL course

## Project

In this project, you will complete the development of a fully functional application for the fictional school you have been working with in the previous labs. You will create a console application that the school can use and that includes the requested functionality below.

### Functions in the program:

- There must be a menu where you can choose to display various data requested by the school. (Console)

- The school wants to be able to generate an overview of all staff members, including their names, positions, and years of service at the school. The administrator also wants the ability to save new staff members. (SQL in SSMS)

- We want to save students and see which class they are in. We want to be able to record grades for a student in each course they have taken, and we want to be able to see which teacher assigned the grade. Grades should also have a date when they were assigned. (SQL in SSMS)

- How many teachers work in the different departments? (EF in VS)

- Display information about all students (EF in VS)

- Display a list of all (active) courses (EF in VS)

- How much does each department pay out in salaries each month? (SQL in SSMS)

- What is the average salary for the different departments? (SQL in SSMS)

- Create a Stored Procedure that takes an Id as input and returns important information about the student registered with that Id. (SQL in SSMS)

- Assign a grade to a student using Transactions in case something goes wrong. (SQL in SSMS)

#Extra Challenges
- Display information about a student, which class they belong to, which teacher(s) they have, and the grades they have received in a specific course. (SQL)
- Create a View that shows all teachers and the courses they are responsible for. (SQL in SSMS)
- Update/correct a student's information programmatically. (EF in VS)
